# Favicon and Logo Files

This project requires the following image files to be added to the public directory:

1. favicon.ico - A small icon displayed in browser tabs (16x16, 32x32 pixels)
2. logo192.png - A 192x192 pixel PNG image for app icons
3. logo512.png - A 512x512 pixel PNG image for app icons

These files are referenced in index.html and manifest.json. 

To avoid 404 errors when running the application, please add these files manually or replace the references to them in the HTML and manifest files.

For a quick solution, you can:
1. Create a simple favicon using an online favicon generator
2. Use placeholder images for the logo files
3. Or remove the references to these files from index.html and manifest.json if they're not needed
