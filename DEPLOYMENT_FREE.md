# Free Deployment Guide (No Credit Card!)

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Using Mock Data)

Since your app works with mock data, you can deploy it for FREE on GitHub Pages right now!

### Steps:

1. **Install gh-pages**:
```bash
cd client
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

2. **Update client/package.json**:
Add homepage and deploy scripts:
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/mechanic_website_daniel",
  "scripts": {
    ...existing scripts,
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
```

3. **Deploy**:
```bash
cd client
npm run deploy
```

Your site will be live at: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/mechanic_website_daniel

### To Use Mock Data in Production:

1. Update `client/src/services/api.ts` to import from mockApi:
```typescript
// At the top of the file
export * from './mockApi';
```

## Option 2: Vercel (Also Free, No Card)

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Import your repository
4. It will auto-deploy!

## Option 3: Netlify (Free, No Card)

1. Build your app locally:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

2. Go to https://netlify.com
3. Drag and drop the `client/build` folder
4. Done!
